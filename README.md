A single-player platformer where you control a robot jumping across platforms in space, avoiding alien enemies. The twist? You use real-time hand gestures via a webcam to control the character, thanks to integrated computer vision technology. This game combines fun gameplay mechanics with innovative gesture-based controls, offering an interactive and immersive experience.

## Features:
- **Gesture-based controls:** Move your robot character using hand movements detected by your webcam.
- **Platformer action:** Navigate through space, jumping between platforms while avoiding flying alien enemies.
- **Computer vision integration:** Leverages OpenCV to track hand movements and translate them into in-game actions.
- **Challenging gameplay:** Avoid obstacles and enemies as you strive for a high score in this fast-paced, space-themed adventure.

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Python (for game logic and computer vision processing)
- **Frontend:** Pygame (for game interface and mechanics)
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (for gesture detection and control)

# Future Improvements:
- **Enhanced AI:** Improve enemy behavior for a more challenging experience.
- **More levels:** Expand the game with new environments and platform challenges.
- **UI/UX updates:** Refine the user interface for smoother gameplay and better feedback.
